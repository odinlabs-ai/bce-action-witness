# BCE external Action witness

This repository is a transparent consumer-side witness for the public BCE onboarding path. It is
separate from `blueprint-conformance/bce` and runs BCE through the generated GitHub Action at an
immutable commit.

This repository is maintained by the BCE creator account. It proves that a real external GitHub
repository can install, configure, and execute the generated Action; it is **not** an independent
human-user attestation.

The committed source is intentionally small. Pull requests may plant and then remove a direct
`axios` import to demonstrate that the same contract reports RED and GREEN without changing policy.

## Reproduce locally

```bash
npm ci
npx --no-install bce demo
npx --no-install bce doctor --repo .
npx --no-install bce gate --repo . --all
```

Policy files, mode, baseline, workflow, and engine pins require explicit human review. The initial
onboarding state is advisory and unratified by design.
